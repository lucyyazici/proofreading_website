The colon can cause confusion as there are many different rules on how to use it: from whether you are writing in British or American English, to the huge variety of style guides out there. Of course, if you are following a particular style guide, it must be referred to, but below I have gathered the main points that can be followed to correctly use the colon along with examples to elaborate on each point. So, let’s get started!

The colon has three main roles: 
- to introduce specific information or an explanation to a general idea
- to introduce a list
- to introduce a quotation. 

Examples for introducing specific information or an explanation to a general idea:

- Never forget this point: think before you speak.
- The world is a stage: play your role well.
- She had only one goal: to win.

When using a colon in this way, it is more common to use a lower-case letter after the colon in British English, while in American English it is more common to use a capital letter.

Examples for introducing a list:

- All adult insects have three body parts: head, thorax and abdomen.
- We’ve invited just a small number of people: Ella, Gemma, Gemma’s sister and Nicholas.
- I bought a lot of vegetables at the supermarket: cabbage, cauliflower, courgette and pumpkin. 

It is important that what precedes the colon is a grammatically complete sentence. 

Look at this sentence: The people I have invited are Ella, Gemma, Gemma’s sister and Nicholas. A colon cannot be used here because there is an incomplete sentence before the list of names.

Examples for introducing a quotation:

- They shouted: “Watch out – it might collapse!”
- As Albus Dumbledore once said: "Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if only one remembers to turn on the light."
- Benjamin Franklin once noted: “Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I will learn.” 

It is also common to introduce a quotation using a comma.

Overall, a colon provides a strong emphasis, pointing the finger to specific information or an explanation to the general idea stated at the beginning of the sentence. Although common in text, it is used sparingly. If you need any help with your use of colons, send me an email.
