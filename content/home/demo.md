My name is Lucy, and I assist authors in making their text look and sound **perfect** in **English**.

As a **proofreader**, I am the final eyes on written projects, looking for things that have been missed in previous stages. I check for **spelling**, **grammar**, and **punctuation** errors and ensure that words flow consistently to enable the reader to hear the authorsâ€™ voice and be lost in their words and thoughts.

I proofread all types of written work, in many different formats, and I am reliable, fast and affordable. I have experience working with both non-native and native speakers of English. Find out more about me and my proofreading experience.
