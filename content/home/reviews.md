  description: "Lucy has been very kind and helpful. I liked the comments she provided with her corrections as they allowed me to choose the most appropriate version of the text. I appreciate kind communication and the fact that the proofs were always returned in time --- in fact, ahead of the deadline we agreed on. I will certainly use her services again."
